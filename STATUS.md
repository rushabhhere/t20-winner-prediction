## What do we need?

- Score Remaining
- Balls Remaining
- Current Run Rate
- Required Run Rate
- Winner/Loser from batting point of view

- Venue and Toss Outcome (pre-match prediction)

## For model:

- Add dropout (bad idea)

## Visualizations needed:

- Outliers
- Correlation
- Distribution of wickets fallen per over
- Distribution of runs scored per over
- Loss vs Accuracy of models over epochs

## To do:

[x] Remove RRR, CRR and see
[ ] Add more layers to the neural network
[ ] Try random forest
[ ] Add custom penalty to loss function
[ ] Streamlit visualization
[ ] Add first innings data
[ ] Add more features
[ ] Reinforcement learning (not looking very useful)

## Models to try:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- SVM
- KNN
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- XGBoost
- Neural Network
